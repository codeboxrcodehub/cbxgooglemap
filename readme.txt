### üßÆ Shortcodes ###

The most short form of the shortcode is `[cbxgooglemap id="google map post id here"]` where id is post id of custom google map post type

We can use shortcode to display saved map (this plugin creates custom post type CBX Maps(cbxgooglemap) in admin to create maps as need) or can display map using custom attributes. For save map we need only one param `[cbxgooglemap id="google map post id here"]`

	id      = post id, can be empty
	--------------------------------
	We can also display map using custom attributes
	maptype = default 'roadmap', possible values, 'roadmap', 'satellite', 'hybrid',  'terrain'
	width   = numeric value, '%' accepted, no 'px', if only numeric value then px will be added automatically
	height  = nemeric value, no 'px'
	zoom    = default 8
	lat     = lattitude value, required
	lng     = longitude value, required
	heading = used for info window title
	website = website url that is linked to place name in popup info window, leave empty to ignore
	address = used for info window content
	scrollwheel = 1 enable , 0 disable, default 1 or comes from default config
	showinfo = 1 enable , 0 disable, default 1 or comes from default config, show popup window or not
	infow_open = 1 enable , 0 disable, default 1 or comes from default config, show popup as opened or on click
	mapicon = map icon url, leave empty to ignore
